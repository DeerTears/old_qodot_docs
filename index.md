# Welcome!

This is the new official documentation for [Qodot Plugin](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/qodot-plugin), a Quake-to-Godot plugin created by Shifty and the Godot community.

[Beginner's Guide to Qodot](/docs/beginner's-guide-to-qodot/) should be the first place you look if you're new to the plugin.

## What is Qodot Plugin?

Qodot Plugin is a powerful and complex tool to convert Quake maps into Godot meshes, collisions, and scenes. You can use map editors like [Trenchbroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/) as a level design tool for your Godot project, using Qodot Plugin to bridge the gap between these two programs.

## How to read this guide

This guide follows a few formatting principles to clarify some of the technical wording.

_Anything In Italics_ is an editor property you can change in the Inspector.

Examples:
-   _Texture_
-   _Material_
-   _Scale_
-   _Fgd Files_

Anything → With → Arrows describes nested, foldable properties or buttons, in either Trenchbroom or Godot.

Examples:
-   File → Save
-   Transform → Position → X
-   Project → Project Settings → Plugins

Any instances of the 🚧 emoji means that this section is not totally researched. You are more than welcome to contribute to [This Wiki's Github page](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/qodotplugin.github.io) to fill out these missing details.

If you are struggling to find information, there's a chance it has been covered by [The Old Qodot Plugin wiki](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/qodot-plugin/wiki) or the [Trenchbroom Manual](https://trenchbroom.github.io/manual/latest/). Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/qodotplugin.github.io/issues/new) if you notice any missing information!

Any text with **Note:** indicates "gotcha" scenarios for less-common situations, or to emphasize any details that are too important to skip during the process.

Any text with **Warning:** is here to prevent you from losing a lot of progress or time. This usually indicates pitfalls and quirks that limit the flexibility of Qodot Plugin.

## Who wrote this?

So hi, I'm [Ember](https://github.com/deertears/). I wrote most of the words on these page, based on my own research and coupled with the work [Shifty](https://github.com/shfty) did for the old Qodot Plugin wiki. As a tutor, I really like sharing knowledge with people, and I created this out of my desire to see something more comprehensive for teaching how the plugin works.

As time goes on Shifty and I will have less to claim as our own work, you can check the [the Contributors list](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/qodotplugin.github.io/graphs/contributors) to see who else was involved in writing these docs.

## Special Thanks

The Jekyll theme is [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) made by [pmarsceill](https://github.com/pmarsceill/).

[Shifty](https://github.com/shfty/) for making such a cool plugin that's enabled so many developers to make stand-out games in the indie sphere.

Also, Ember would like to thank everyone reading, and especially everyone who's come to give input and feedback on these docs as they've developed.
