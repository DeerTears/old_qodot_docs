# Welcome!

This is the new official documentation for [Qodot Plugin](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/qodot-plugin), a Quake-to-Godot plugin created by Shifty and the Godot community.

[Beginner's Guide to Qodot](/docs/beginner's-guide-to-qodot/) should be the first place you look if you're new to the plugin.

## What is Qodot Plugin?

Qodot Plugin is a powerful and complex tool to convert Quake maps into Godot meshes, collisions, and scenes. You can use map editors like [Trenchbroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/) as a level design tool for your Godot project, using Qodot Plugin to bridge the gap between these two programs.

## How to read this guide

This guide follows a few formatting principles to clarify some of the technical wording.

_Anything In Italics_ is an editor property you can change in the Inspector.

Examples:
-   _Texture_
-   _Material_
-   _Scale_
-   _Fgd Files_

Anything â†’ With â†’ Arrows describes nested, foldable properties or buttons, in either Trenchbroom or Godot.

Examples:
-   File â†’ Save
-   Transform â†’ Position â†’ X
-   Project â†’ Project Settings â†’ Plugins

Any instances of the ðŸš§ emoji means that this section is not totally researched. You are more than welcome to contribute to [This Wiki's Github page](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/qodotplugin.github.io) to fill out these missing details.

If you are struggling to find information, there's a chance it has been covered by [The Old Qodot Plugin wiki](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/qodot-plugin/wiki) or the [Trenchbroom Manual](https://trenchbroom.github.io/manual/latest/). Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/qodotplugin.github.io/issues/new) if you notice any missing information!

Any text with **Note:** indicates "gotcha" scenarios for less-common situations, or to emphasize any details that are too important to skip during the process.

Any text with **Warning:** is here to prevent you from losing a lot of progress or time. This usually indicates pitfalls and quirks that limit the flexibility of Qodot Plugin.

## Who made this?

So hi, I'm [Ember](https://github.com/deertears/). I really like sharing knowledge with people, and I created this out of my desire to see something more comprehensive for teaching how the plugin works. I've spent countless hours doing research, answering user questions, and recording steps as I've put this together. This has been my largest open-source documentation project yet. I really appreciate everyone who's come to give input, feedback, and generally just use what I've written.

The Jekyll theme is [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) made by [pmarsceill](https://github.com/pmarsceill/).

I want to sincerely thank [Shifty](https://github.com/shfty/)for making such a cool plugin that's enabled so many developers, as well as for letting me take over the documentation and rebuild it from the ground up.
