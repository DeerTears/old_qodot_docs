# Qodot Docs

This site is the work in progress documentation for the Quake-to-Godot plugin, [Qodot](https://github.com/Shfty/qodot-plugin/).

**Please let me know if you see anything incorrect, unexpectedly unfinished, or something that just needs more work.** The fastest way to contact me is by pinging me, Ember#1765, through the [Qodot Discord](https://discord.gg/c72WBuG).

I won't accept your friend request if you're not already in the [Qodot Discord](https://discord.gg/c72WBuG).

Not all information from [the official Qodot wiki on Github](https://github.com/Shfty/qodot-plugin/wiki/) is here. However, once this guide covers most use cases for the tool, the plan is to supersede the wiki using an official documentation repository through the official Qodot account.

While these docs aren't done and aren't official, you are welcome to raise issues and submit PRs to make corrections. Just remember that you can talk to me faster and sooner through the [Qodot Discord](https://discord.gg/c72WBuG).

This one-page guide is instead intended for all Qodot users (beginners or rusty veterans) who are looking to understand more about the plugin with step-by-step instructions.
