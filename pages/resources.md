# Resources

Unlike [Beginner's Guide to Qodot](https://coda.io/d/Trenchbroom-Guide_d77T7fADkTg/Beginners-Guide-to-Qodot_suWQh#_luOXt), this is not a step-by-step series on how to use Trenchbroom. There are already an amazing handful of resources on how to use the program.

Here you can find resources to just about anything you need to get started with Trenchbroom.

## Trenchbroom Manual
Most quirks, setup, and explanations of Trenchbroom’s features are in text through the Trenchbroom manual:

## Starter Kits
If you’re making Quake maps and you need somewhere to start as far as skipping setup or getting some textures to use, here’s where you can find some resource packs.

Full Tutorial Series
You don’t need to make Quake maps to learn Trenchbroom. However, mapping for Quake is still a great way to get started making tangible maps with Trenchbroom soon as possible. The only thing required to run your maps in Quake is a non-shareware copy of Quake 1.

### Extra Tips
Here’s some extra Trenchboom-geometry videos that I couldn’t fit into the other categories.

Join faces, Extrude brush from face, Use another brush face as a clipping plane

## Textures
This section covers where to get textures, and a little bit on how to make your own. This is a mix of resources covering Quake texture methods and modern PBR texture methods.

John Romero’s Level Design Rules:

1. Always change floor height when changing floor textures. (0:28)
2. Use border textures between different wall segments and doorways. (1:05)
3. Be strict about texture alignment. (1:47)
4. Use contrast between light and dark areas and cramped and open areas. (2:25)
5. Make sure that if the player can see outside, he can somehow get there. (3:13)
6. Be strict about having several secret areas on each level. (3:53)
7. Make levels flow so that the player revisits areas to better understand the 3D space. (4:44)
8. Create several easily-recognizable landmarks for easier navigation. (5:49)
