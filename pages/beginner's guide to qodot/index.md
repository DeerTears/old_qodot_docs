# Prerequisites

You should know the basics of using:
- [Trenchbroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/)
- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)

You should have the latest stable version of either program installed.

[Beginner's Guide to Trenchbroom](https://coda.io/d/Trenchbroom-Guide_d77T7fADkTg/Beginners-Guide-to-Trenchbroom_suqnS) has a list of resources to learn more about using Trenchbroom.

# Where to start

[Installation](installation.md) shows how to install the plugin from a blank, or otherwise Qodot-less project.

[Building Maps](building-maps.md) teaches the absolute basics of building maps.

[Applying Textures](applying-textures.md) shows how to integrate Trenchbroom with Godot, so you can apply your Godot project's textures using Trenchbroom.
