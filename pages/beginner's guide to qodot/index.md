# Beginner's Guide to Qodot

Welcome! If you get stuck at any time, feel free to ask us on the [Qodot Plugin Discord](https://discord.gg/c72WBuG).

## Prerequisites

You should have the latest stable version of both [Trenchbroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/) and [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) installed.

It helps to know the basics of navigating in Godot's 3D editor and Trenchbroom's 3D editor.

The [Additional Resources](../additional-resources.html) page has a list of resources to learn more about using Trenchbroom and Godot if you get stuck.

## Getting Started

You can read:

1. [Installation](installation.md) to install the plugin from a blank, or otherwise Qodot-less project.
2. [Building Maps](building-maps.md) to learn absolute basics of building maps.
3. [Applying Textures](applying-textures.md) to integrate Trenchbroom with Godot, so you can apply your Godot project's textures using Trenchbroom.

After reading all three pages, you will know the basics of using Qodot to build maps and texutre them.
